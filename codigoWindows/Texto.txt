Actions are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations 
across Pipedream's 500+ API integrations. 
For example, you can use actions to send email, add a row to a Google Sheet, and more.

Create Issue - Triggers when your username is mentioned in a Commit, Comment, Issue or Pull 
Request. (code)
Get Repository - Triggered when a new milestone is created. (code)
Search Issues - Triggered when a new pull request is created. (code)
You can create your own actions, which you can re-use across workflows. You can also publish 
actions to the entire Pipedream community, 
making them available for anyone to use.
