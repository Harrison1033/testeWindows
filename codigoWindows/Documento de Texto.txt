Key Features
Workflows - Workflows run automations. Workflows are sequence of steps - pre-built actions or 
custom Node.js, Python, Golang, or Bash code - triggered by an event (HTTP request, timer, 
new row added to a Google Sheet, and more).

Event Sources - Sources trigger workflows. They emit events from services like GitHub, Slack, 
Airtable, RSS and more. When you want to run a workflow when an event happens in any third-party 
pp, you're using an event source.

Actions - Actions are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common 
operations across Pipedream's 500+ API integrations. For example, you can use actions to send 
email, add a row to a Google Sheet, and more.

Custom code - Most integrations require custom logic. Code is often the best way to express that 
logic, so Pipedream allows you to run any Node.js, Python, Golang, or Bash code. You can import 
any package from the languages' package managers, connect to any Pipedream connected app, and 
ore. Pipedream is "low-code" in the best way: you can use pre-built components when you're 
performing common actions, but you can write custom code when you need to.

Destinations - Deliver events asynchronously to common destinations like Amazon S3, Snowflake, 
HTTP and email

Free - No fees for individual developers (see limits)
